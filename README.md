These are scripts for functionality that is implemented directly in javascript and doesn´t have dependencies in any framework.

Sometimes you need functionality but don't want to compromise with a big framework. You want to have the chance of changing frameworks without reworking all your functionality.

gobalRequestEvents.js: 
Adds a document event when fetch is started, completed or failed.

httpHiddenMethod.js: 
Converts the method of fetch to a param if for some reason your server doesn't support it because of security policies not controlled by you.

hashtracker.js:
Allows to register functions when the hash location changes.

tasks.js
A small class to abstract an execution. Helpful to reflect user interface state and task execution status.
